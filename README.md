## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- A **Spotify Developer** account

---

## Register Your Spotify App

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
2. Click **"Create an App"**, give it a name/description.
3. In your new app's settings, add a **Redirect URI**. It doesn't need to be a real, reachable page — it's only used once to complete the login and read the `code` param back out of the address bar (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback`).
4. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for the next step.

## Configure Environment Variables

Spotipy reads these automatically, either from your shell environment or a `.env` file in the project root:

| Variable                | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`      | Client ID from your Spotify app                                    |
| `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`  | Client Secret from your Spotify app                                |
| `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI`   | The Redirect URI you registered above                              |
| `SPOTIFY_TOKEN_CACHE_PATH` (optional) | Where to store the cached OAuth token. Defaults to `~/.cache/spotify_release_token.json` |

Example `.env`:

```
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback
```

---

## Usage

```bash
python new_release_main.py
```

On the very first run, no cached token exists yet, so the script prints a Spotify authorization URL. Open it, log in, approve access, then paste the URL you're redirected to back into the terminal when prompted. This creates the token cache file, and every run after that refreshes silently with no further interaction — until Spotify invalidates the refresh token (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

The script will:

1. List every artist you follow.
2. Find tracks released by those artists in the last 3 days (skipping remixes, live versions, and anything under 1 minute long).
3. Create or reuse a playlist named **"New Releases"**.
4. Remove tracks older than 14 days from that playlist.
5. Add the new tracks to the top.

---

## Scheduling with GitHub Actions

The repo includes [`.github/workflows/daily.yml`](.github/workflows/daily.yml), which runs the script daily at 01:00 UTC and can also be triggered manually from the **Actions** tab ("Run workflow").

To set it up on your own fork:

1. Run the script once locally (see [Usage](#usage)) to generate a token cache file.
2. In your repo's **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add:
   - `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`
   - `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI`
   - `SPOTIFY_TOKEN_CACHE` — the full contents of the token cache file generated in step 1
3. Push to `main`. The workflow starts running on its schedule from then on.

Note: GitHub automatically disables scheduled workflows after 60 days with no repository activity (pushes/commits — the scheduled runs themselves don't count). If that happens, go to **Actions → Daily New Releases** and click **"Enable workflow"**.

## Troubleshooting

**`SpotifyOauthError: invalid_grant, error_description: Refresh token expired/revoked`**

The cached refresh token was invalidated on Spotify's side — usually because access was revoked under `open.spotify.com` → your account → **Apps**, or the app's Client Secret was regenerated in the developer dashboard. There's no code fix: delete the stale token cache (locally, or the `SPOTIFY_TOKEN_CACHE` secret in Actions) and redo the login flow described in [Usage](#usage) to mint a new one.
